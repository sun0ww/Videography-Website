				<!-- this project is a website for a videographer, so its a good idea to grab the viewer's attention and to showcase their work.
					I embedded a video from my vimeo account as a placeholder, but if this were a website for another videographer, 
					most of the videos and images would obviosly be replaced by their own images and videos. -->

					<!-- the video is privated on my account, so adding a fallback that links to my profile wont do anything. 
					of course, this would be changed if i was using content from a videographer's youtube channel-->
